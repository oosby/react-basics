# react-basics

## Chapter 2
We'll continue with `<App />` and explore the `componentWillMount` lifecycle method.

### ComponentWillMount
[docs:](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillmount)
componentWillMount() is invoked just before mounting occurs. It is called before render()

- This method isn't as useful as it was in earlier React versions.
- It might get merged with constructor
- This method may be called multiple times before the first render


## Local setup
- clone the repo
- make sure you're on node 8 and npm 5
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
